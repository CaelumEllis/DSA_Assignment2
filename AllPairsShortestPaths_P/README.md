Unfortunalty this repo does not contain working commits as I pushed directly to Ed as required for the assignment.
Also had to delay uploading as it was request to wait to end of the Semester before uploading this assignment.
Note that some test cases in main are commented out, I believe those were the ones which had strange behaviour, 
they would fail in my local environment, but when I pushed to Ed I passed them. 
(It could have also been a result of my final debugging that I commented them out)
